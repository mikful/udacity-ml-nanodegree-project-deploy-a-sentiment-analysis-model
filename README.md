# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files here, are the completed version of my Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Project 1 - Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model using Amazon SageMaker and AWS. The completed project provides a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network (bidirectional LSMT) performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.
